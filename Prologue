It’s 1779 miles from the Shire to Mordor following Frodo and Sam’s journey. (https://dayzeroproject.com/goal/1070818)

We have the distance (though different websites will have slightly different numbers).  Still, it is an ambitious walking plan 
so an easier to achieve goal may be desirable. For example, walk the yellow brick road.

We will need a break down to create a database of where along the route your progress compares to that of the fellowship.
We need a place to keep track of how far you have walked.
A way to measure how far you have walked.
A nice frontend.
