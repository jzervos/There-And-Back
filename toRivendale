Walking from Bagend to Rivendale will take 458 miles and was how far I got the last time I attempted this walk.
In day one, the hobbits walked 18 miles.  It is important to note that they did use horses and how fast they moved
is likely beyond what most people will be able to attempt.

5 miles: Brandywine Bridge and you have left Hobbiton
14.5 miles: reach Stock Road
18 miles: set up camp and sleep                                       End Day One
32 miles: Black Rider
37 miles: road splits
41 miles: black rider and elves help them escape
46 miles: rest with Woodhall in sight                                 End Day Two
54 miles: cry of Black Rider
73 miles: camp at Creekhollow                                         End Day Three
95 miles: Tom Bombidil
98 miles: rest at Tom's house                                         End Day Four and Five
115 miles: captured by Wights                                         End Day Six
135 Reach Bree and The Prancing Pony                                  End Day Seven


On reflection, I want to establish the framework.  The trail is just data that can be added.  
More details should probably be added.  Perhaps some random encounters could be added.
For this app to ultimately be interesting, something should happen each time they open and use it.
For example, track how long it has been since they last walked.  Give them their own story of how they walked to Mordor.
Eventually, keep a diary in the app that could be printed as a PDF.
Don't forget nice graphics.
